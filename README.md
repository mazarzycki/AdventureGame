 # Fantastic Adventure
It's an easy game using the idea of gamebooks where the reader participates in the story. </br>
It's only demo version of a more complicated story I have in mind. Its main purpose was to practice and prepare a piece of work I could use in my portfolio. 
It was written using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 
Your objective in the game is to defeat all your opponents and save the princess.
